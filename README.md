# MTLS
Multiple Timeline Summarization using Clustering

My bachelors projct where i implemented a master students thesis.


This MTLS model uses Bert models for text vectorization and text similarity detection while seperating similar text related to an event using clustering (KMeans for initial clustering and DBScan).

The corpus used is one of news text avilable and linked [here](https://yiyualt.github.io/mtlsdata/).

This projects code is incomplete and has been passed to the masters student to be completed as arranged by the project supervisor.
